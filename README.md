## 📌 Description:
An intuitive application for creating, visualizing, and analyzing graphs, built in C# using WinForms.

## 🚀 Features:
- **Graph Creation:** Add and remove vertices and edges, including parallel edges, loops, and directed edges.
- **Graph Manipulation:** Reposition vertices and edges by click-and-drag.
- **Graph Coloring:** Apply heuristics for minimal colorings and chromatic numbers.
- **Graph Information:** 
  - View the number of vertices and edges.
  - Calculate vertex degrees and graph component count.
  - Generate adjacency matrices.
  - Determine bipartite graphs.
  - Identify bridges and links.
- **Graph Algorithms:** 
  - Dijkstra's Shortest Path Algorithm.
  - Ford-Fulkerson Max Flow Algorithm.
  - Spanning Tree Construction.
- **Advanced Operations:** Calculate Cartesian products of graphs.
